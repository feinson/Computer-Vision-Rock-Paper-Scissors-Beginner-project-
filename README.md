# Computer Vision RPS

## Model training
The model was created using the website teachablemachine.withgoogle.com.
The model was trained to sort images into one of four classes: rock, paper, scissors and nothing. The training set was images of me making the signs into my webcam. The model seems to work great for pictures of me holding up the symbol, but given an unfamiliar setting it might be a bit haphazard. This could of course be improved by providing a much larger training set.
